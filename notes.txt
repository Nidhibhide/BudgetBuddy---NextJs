- Client Layout: For browser-only stuff (hooks, context, UI) while main layout stays server-rendered (faster + SEO-friendly).  

- NextAuth automatically manages JWTs.  
  - No need to manually use jwt.sign() or jwt.verify().  

- JWT: Internal token managed by NextAuth.  
- Session: Frontend-friendly object to check login status and get user details in React/Next.js.  

- In Express.js:  
  - Use short-lived access tokens (~15 min).  
  - Use long-lived refresh tokens (~30 days) to get new access tokens.  
  - Required because Express doesn’t manage sessions automatically.  

- In NextAuth:  
  - JWT strategy token acts as both access + refresh token.  
  - Token valid until maxAge (default 30 days).  
  - No separate refresh token needed for email/password login.  
  - Refresh logic only needed for OAuth providers (e.g., Google) since their access tokens expire quickly.  

- App JWT lasts 1 hour; re-login needed afterward.
- Google access token refreshes automatically when expired.
- Refresh is independent of the 1-hour JWT; users stay logged in via Google.

-Server component vs Client component 
-In Next js by default is Server component in app folder 
-we cant use async with client component 
-Server component - Data / api keys are kept secret on the server ( safe for private keys)
-iF client component imports another component that imported one becomes a client component too if it doesnt have 'use client'
- Next.js App Router:
  - Folder structure defines routes (e.g., app/dashboard/page.tsx).
  - Server components render initial HTML for SEO/performance.
  - Client components hydrate for interactivity with 'use client'.

- NextAuth Authentication:
  - Credentials/Google providers in options.ts.
  - authorize() validates user, returns session data.
  - JWT callback manages tokens, session callback populates client.

- Next-intl Internationalization:
  - i18n.ts defines languages, defaultLanguage.
  - First request: Middleware detects locale from URL (e.g., /en/dashboard) or Accept-Language header, defaults to 'mr'.
  - Server-side only: getRequestConfig() (from next-intl/server) loads messages from JSON file (e.g., messages/en.json) via dynamic import; client requests don't execute this as it's server-only.
  - RootLayout calls getMessages() to fetch translations server-side for initial render.
  - ClientLayout receives messages as props, NextIntlClientProvider stores them in React context memory.
  - Client components use useTranslations() hook to access t() function from context (no additional requests for same locale).
  - Client-side navigation: Uses cached messages in memory; no server call unless locale changes.
  - Locale change: Middleware redirects to new path (e.g., /hi), server reloads messages, re-renders app.

- Middleware Execution:
  - Runs before every request matching matcher.
  - intlMiddleware handles locale routing.
  - withAuth checks token for protected paths.










- Theme Provider:
  - next-themes detects system preference.
  - attribute="class" toggles Tailwind classes.
  - useTheme() hook switches modes.
