- Client Layout: For browser-only stuff (hooks, context, UI) while main layout stays server-rendered (faster + SEO-friendly).  

- NextAuth automatically manages JWTs.  
  - No need to manually use jwt.sign() or jwt.verify().  

- JWT: Internal token managed by NextAuth.  
- Session: Frontend-friendly object to check login status and get user details in React/Next.js.  

- In Express.js:  
  - Use short-lived access tokens (~15 min).  
  - Use long-lived refresh tokens (~30 days) to get new access tokens.  
  - Required because Express doesn’t manage sessions automatically.  

- In NextAuth:  
  - JWT strategy token acts as both access + refresh token.  
  - Token valid until maxAge (default 30 days).  
  - No separate refresh token needed for email/password login.  
  - Refresh logic only needed for OAuth providers (e.g., Google) since their access tokens expire quickly.  


- App JWT lasts 1 hour; re-login needed afterward.
- Google access token refreshes automatically when expired.
- Refresh is independent of the 1-hour JWT; users stay logged in via Google.
